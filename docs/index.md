## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with ROS, it is highly recommended that you read the [ROS Tutorials](http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials) 
If you are unfamiliar with the terminal on Linux, you should look [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/183775/how-do-i-open-a-terminal)
Shadow software is deployed using Docker. Docker is a container framework where each container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run it. It is similar to a virtual machine but with much less overhead. Follow the instructions in the next section to get the latest Docker container of the grasper up and running.
